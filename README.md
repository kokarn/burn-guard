Burn Guard
==========

A simple way to try to minimize image persistence (burnt in image) on LCD's, Plasmas and CRT's.

The problem is described here [Image Persistance](http://compreviews.about.com/od/monitors/a/LCDBurnIn.htm) and here [Screen Burn-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in).

Ideas and most code from [Brad Christie](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4741657/javascript-for-preventing-burn-in-problem-on-lcd-screen) and [Kroltan](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19506891/suggested-algorithms-to-prevent-image-persistence-on-an-lcd-screen/19507703#19507703).

This is no guarantee that it wont burn, it's just something i've strung together from a bunch of discussion on Stack Overflow. I take no responsibility if this doesn't help and you still get stuff burnt in.
